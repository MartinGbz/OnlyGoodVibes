# OnlyGoodVibes ðŸ¤—

## The "bad news-free" social network

This project is an **MVP** of a social network that eliminates all the bad news from your [Lens Protocol](https://www.lens.xyz/) feed.

When you connect your wallet, OnlyGoodVibes will fetch your default Lens feed (already created by the Lens API). Then it will ask ChatGPT to send a feedback for each post (true => good news, false => bad news).

All messages considered like "bad news" or "neutral news"(1) are then blurred out on the UI.

You'll never be in a bad mood on the social networks again ðŸ˜‹

> (1) : As OnlyGooVibes is an MVP, the aim is to showcase the concept. By including neutral news I multiply my chances of there being blurred content in the feed, allowing everyone to see how it works.
